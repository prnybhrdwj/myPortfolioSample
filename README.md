# myPortfolioSample
This project is about a sample portfolio webpage. The webpage has basic components of a portfolio, including name, title, about me and list of projects. 
This was made as part of Udacity course.
# Parts of the code
There are 4 files used for this-
1) index.html - It has all the HTML for the webpage.
2) myPortfolio.css - It contains all CSS used in the webpage.
3) creativity.jpg - This is a placeholder image that is used throughout the webpage and will be replaced later as we add projects
4) udacity-logo - This is udacity logo used on top of webpage because of lack of an alternate logo
# Guidelines to use
1) Clone all four files on your computer. Keep them in the same folder
2) Run html-myPortfolio.html by double clicking. It should open in your web browser.
